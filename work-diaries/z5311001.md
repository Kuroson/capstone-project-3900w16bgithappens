- What was finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered

# Week 1

Group was formed in our tutorial and we had a meeting to discuss which project we would undertake. We eventually settled on the Learning Management System (LMS) as it was a project everyone was comfortable with taking and we felt like we could provide our own personal experiences as tutors to include some novel features.

In our next team meeting, we planned out our base user stories and brainstormed ideas for our novel features. We eventually settled on an implementation of gamification and progress tracking. We also decided to start planing out the technologies we would use for our project. Whilst discussing the our tech stack, questions about the limitations of the project arose, such as whether if we were allowed to use 3rd party services to simplify our implementation. All of the questions were written down on a Confluence post to be asked in the next meeting with our tutor.

The plan for the following week is to finalise our user stories and novelty features and start to delegate parts of the proposal to team members.

# Week 2

During our lab meeting with our tutor, we were able to get clarification to most questions we had on the limitations and scope of the project. As a group, we then finalised our two novelty features and user stories. We then started to delegate parts of the reports to different team members. I was assigned with the system architecture part of the proposal.

I completed a draft of the system architecture section of the proposal, creating 2 diagrams to illustrate the technologies used in the different layers and a higher level abstraction showing the flow of data between the different layers and components. I also wrote a short description of each layer and the technologies used with some basic rationale. I am unsure how much detail is required for this section, so I will clarify this with the tutor the following week.

The plan for the next week is to complete the system architecture proposal by first getting clarification on the scope/detail of the section then getting a team member to review it. If there is extra time left over, then it may be spent on the implementation.

# Week 3

What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry

- Completion of the proposal for submission. My part was specifically the system architecture section.

What was finished

- Completed the system architecture section of the proposal by re-drawing the layer diagrams and adding more detail to the description of each layer.
- We also had a meeting to finalise the document for submission on Sunday.
- I also started created the base infrastructure for our project.
  - Creating and configuring both the frontend and backend codebases
  - Introduced CI/CD to the project
  - Deployed frontend onto Vercel and backend onto Heroku
  - Created MongoDB and configured it with the backend via Mongoose
  - I added a backend and frontend section, configuring both to work with a continuous integration workflow.
- We also started our sprint on Sunday.
  - I was able to complete my ticket `GH-2` which included page Sign In, Sign out and Login.
