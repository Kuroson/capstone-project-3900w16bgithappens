# Week 1

Group was formed in our tutorial and we had a meeting to discuss which project we would undertake. We eventually settled on the Learning Management System (LMS) as it was a project everyone was comfortable with taking and we felt like we could provide our own personal experiences as tutors to include some novel features.

In our next team meeting, we planned out our base user stories and brainstormed ideas for our novel features. We eventually settled on an implementation of gamification and progress tracking. We also decided to start planing out the technologies we would use for our project. Whilst discussing the our tech stack, questions about the limitations of the project arose, such as whether if we were allowed to use 3rd party services to simplify our implementation. All of the questions were written down on a Confluence post to be asked in the next meeting with our tutor.

The plan for the following week is to finalise our user stories and novelty features and start to delegate parts of the proposal to team members.
