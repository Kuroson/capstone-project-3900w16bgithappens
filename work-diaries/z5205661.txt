Since last week, I aimed to complete the frontend for my Workload Overview feature. There were two main pieces of functionality achieved from this: The instructor view and functionality and the student view and functionality.
The instructor can create a To do list of action items for students to complete. These lists of action items are specific to each page/week. These action items can be edited and deleted and whole lists can be removed. 
A student can view the To do list on each specific course page. Alternatively they can view all workloads on a single page

The main technical obstacles was that I wasn't as familiar with frontend as I was with the backend. The last time I had worked with React or implemented some kind of frontend was when I did COMP6080 in Term 3 2022
I was also not familiar with Next.Js, or Typescript for frontend, so it took time getting use to it. I mostly struggled with understanding how types work in typescript. Thankfully I had Alvin Cherk on the team to explain and help me debug typescript errors. 
I will get better with the more typescript I use.

I also helped Aditi complete her ticket" GH-15- Manage student forums" by fixing up the frontend and styling of the forums for both the instructor and the student view.
This was completed and had no affect on the overall project progress.
